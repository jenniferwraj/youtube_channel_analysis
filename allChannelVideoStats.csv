It was really adventurous and thrilling to do the trekking and rappelling. I am very interested to share my feedback for Thrillophilia reviews. 

The climb was through steep trails mixed with boulders and large stones and it was too windy. But the views of the village down from the top are cherish-able. 

There were other groups also to do trekking from different parts of Bangalore but we could blend with them easily before the start of the trek. 

It was actually a new experience for all of us in our family. Rappelling was killer. We were scared but the supporting team helped us and the safety gears provided were good so I just took of my hands from the rope and continued rappelling. 

It was a nice experience I ever had. Since we have done the trekking too slowly, none of us was tired after it. Also, the organizers provided refreshments after we reached the top. 

Juice, biscuits, glucose and all. They were really nice. The place looked amazing with so much green landscapes around as well as small houses and extensive fields. 

It is quite a refreshing place to go with family for one day trips. My children also liked the activities and the place. With this package we got lunch as well. 

It was fine. I am happy with the people in our group, the organizers, the instructors, the safety measures taken by them and the overall arrangements. 

Everything went on well, on time and without any problems. It was a new feeling for me as something adventure was happening for the first time in my life. 

I am thankful to Thrillophilia for showing me such a nice package at a reasonable rate. They have arranged transportation as well from Bangalore city. 

The drive was nice in a tempo traveler with 8 other people from Bangalore itself. This trip had changed my fears and attitudes towards adventure.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","39","0","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QD01lro44A"

Surrounded by the ancient jungles and hot pink-purple sunsets, these islands are still a mystery to most of the travellers. Already curious to come to this pristine dreamland archipelago? Then don’t wait up and book a trip to Andaman right away! 

Check out major attractions of this video:

2:08 : Candle Light Dinner in Andaman (http://bit.ly/CandleLightDinnerInAndaman)
1:53 : Kala Patthar Beach (http://bit.ly/KalaPattharBeach)
0:18 : Radhanagar Beach (http://bit.ly/RadhanagarBeach)

Out of the total of 572 islands, only 32 are inhabited, and only a few of these are open for tourists. Most of the islands, although geographically closer to Myanmar and Indonesia, are inhabited by a population of South and South-East Asians along with the tribal communities. 

The starting point of any Andaman tour, the bustling capital Port Blair welcomes you to the far-flung archipelago. While you get used to the pristine blue here, viewing the light and sound show at the Cellular Jail will surely worth your time. As you ferry further, you will be able to witness the several Andaman Islands that are prettier than the previous one ready to blow your minds.

By far, the most famous island here is Havelock Island because of its splendid diving opportunities. A few notches away from its sister is the easy-going Neil island that offers a delightful view of rice-fields, palm trees and rocky beaches perfect for lazing around. On the other hand, Ross Island, now known as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island is quite famous for the ruins of British administrative headquarters. It can be quickly reached as it is just 2 kilometres away from Port Blair. 

On a guided walking tour on the islands, you can witness the colourful coral reef as the morning low tides unfold the magical underwater life. As the water recedes, you can marvel at the staghorn corals, boulder corals, some stubby finger-shaped corals, as well as the magical colour-changing corals. Spot the colourful fish running around in the salt pools and stealthy eels peeping from the rocky lairs, all this without the hassles of unclear glass-bottomed boat rides or snorkelling equipment.    

Nowadays, the mystical Andaman Nicobar islands are on the radar of every traveller from all corners of the world. Replete with excellent water sports like surfing, scuba diving, snorkelling, the serious divers and backpackers flock here for a great adventure.

Even famous personalities like Johnny Depp come here to unwind on the pristine secluded islands. Although, of all the travellers, most Indians come here for their exotic Andaman honeymoon with the newly-wed brides easily distinguished by their wrists covered in red bangles. Even with all this influx of varied tourists, you will still be able to enjoy the remote Andaman and Nicobar islands that are scattered like pearls in the sea.

"25","5fv1_LhTPGg","Thrillophilia Reviews: Adventure Activities Around Bangalore","2017-09-07T12:41:15Z","We have done an adventurous outing around Bangalore at Makalidurga on a weekend and it was fantastic and we all had a great experience as a team. 

We booked through Thrillophilia Bangalore and I think this was one of the best packages I have ever got. We have shared our feedback through Thrillophilia Bangalore reviews platform after the trek itself as we were so happy to take this outing up. 

Makalidurga is a great place to enjoy some time with your friends or colleagues and do some adventure activities. We are Bangaloreans only so it was quite easy for us to reach there. 

It was a great team came with us. All of them were really supportive and enjoyable. 

We have done trekking and kayaking. Since we did it during noon, it was really tiring. The boulders were letting us have the maximum adventure but we enjoyed every bit of climbing the hill. 

The lake is so beautiful to do kayaking and all. In the middle of the lake, we jumped into and enjoyed a lot. 

The lake was so deep and I was scared a bit in the beginning but really liked it after sometime. During the trek also, it was not an easy path we had to cover. 

There were a lot of thorns on the way and it was really dry around. If you are a bit careful, you can escape from getting bruised. 

From the top of the hill, the lake looks so pretty and that was a really exciting moment for all of us. In short, the trip was simply superb and beautiful. 

I never thought that I could do these activities but after reaching the point and seeing the people around, I gained confidence and my friends supported me very well. 

It was so adventurous to do the trek and kayaking but the staff encouraged us and the representatives of Thrillophilia were there and they were really superb in supporting the people.
 
They have covered a feedback session also after the activities and I guess almost all of the people in our group had only good things to say about this package. 

There were around five or six groups with different number of people each and every one had a great time at this place. 

Thank you Thrillophilia for offering such a wonderful package to make our weekend an awesome one. 

I think out of Thrillophilia team outing packages, this one is the nicest. It was a different experience altogether and we are really thankful to the coordinators.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","411","0","1","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fv1_LhTPGg"

We have gone to many team outings before through this platform and so they were like our trusted guys. So we connected with the team and Rohit made all the arrangement for team outing. 

It was such a nice trip for all of us. We had lots of fun and adventure activities during the day.  We were 25 people who went on this day outing and each one of us had lots and lots of fun.  

We never thought we would have so much fun in a day but it was really very exciting. We started at around 7:00 AM in the morning and reached our campsite at around 9:00 PM. 

It was such a beautiful place.  I love the location and also the transportation facilities provided to us were really great. When we reached there we were welcomed with a delicious breakfast and some snacks. 

After that, we were divided into small teams for our team building activities. Our first team activity was jungle survival, we had to use some tactics and work together as a team to reach our goal. 

Once this was completed we went on to do another team building activity like raft building, this is the fun part when you have to work and collect together with your team and build a raft. 

It was really fun. Few of our colleagues went for rafting and kayaking. I have been waiting for a long time to try zip line and this time I did it and it was really fun.  

Few of them were busy with archery and hiding the target, it was so much fun. We have to have some good time when it started raining. 

And instead of running away from the rain we started enjoying the rain and headed to the swimming pool. It was such a great day for us. After drying up we had some amazing lunch. 

They have arranged a huge table where all of us sat together had our meals. Wow, it was such an amazing feeling to have all collogues together and chit chats with some usual talks.

Thrillophilia has made so much effort in making our trip a memorable one. Not only they bought our corporate family together but also made our outing the most exciting and memorable one. 

I am definitely going to share my experience in Thrillophilia review Bangalore.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","88","1","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5whYKjJwSmQ"

"34","9K4StilReks","Thrillophilia Reviews: Trekking around Bangalore","2017-09-07T12:50:26Z","We had a great outing near Bangalore recently and we have done trekking as a part of the outing. It was the greatest treks I have ever done. 

All the members in our office were there in the outing and we got this package through Thrillophilia. 

All of us were really happy to go for this outing and thusI thought I would share my experience with Thrillophilia review Bangalore. 

It was an awesome trip with our office people and it helped us know each other better. Also, it was a nice break from the office troubles and tensions. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Trekking was challenging but from the top, the scenery was amazing. It was too windy all the time and I was not tired after the activity. 

We spent some good time on the top of the hill. Our managers were actually glad that they could take us to such a nice place
for outing. 

We started the trekking around 07:00 in the morning and it took almost three hours to reach the top. Everyone was slow as it was a huge steep upward and the trail was going through grasslands
and boulder filled paths. 

But the greenery surprised me. It was sunny on the top but the wind did not make us feel tired or irritated. Thrillophilia supporting team and the local operator were there to help us and they were really doing a great job throughout. 

They provided us refreshments on time. After the trekking, we had some mind blowing team building activities too. Since it was a one day trip we had to finish it by evening and return to Bangalore. 

We have done some fun games and I was really surprised to see many of the shy people in our office was participating in the games without any shyness. 

After the activities, our manager and head talked us about the reason why we are conducting outing and I agree to what he said that it was a great learning experience. 

It was letting us communicate with each other properly and that would help us build a good bonding with each other while at work. 

The place looked extremely beautiful and thank you Thrillophilia for giving us such a wonderful place for our outing.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","95","0","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K4StilReks"

Stretching around 20 kilometers, the country’s most ideal river for rafting, Beas river can make you experience this activity like never before. It is one of the best places for river rafting in Manali. In Beas, there are four types of rapids, which are categorized into Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 on the basis of water turbulence. Grade 1 makes for smooth rafting with less turbulence while Grade 4 makes for vibrant and long rapids with the maximum turbulence to test the skills of the expert rafters. So whether you want to experience river rafting in the low turbulent water currents or want to indulge in white water rafting and test your skills in the high turbulent water currents - rafting here will not disappoint you. 

As for the rafting in Manali cost, it varies between INR 500 and INR 2500 depending on the company. It usually comes clubbed into different packages that include overnight accommodation as well as food. With the price for river rafting in Manali kept totally budget-friendly, you can easily fit this activity on your trip without burning a hole in your pocket.

The rafting normally begins at Pirdi, the starting point of the activity in Kullu-Manali. The route of rafting from Pirdi usually encompasses Bajaura, Sarabhai, Bhuntar and Shamshi, Mohal, Raisol, and Katrain. The most preferred and longest route happens to be the 14 kilometers long (Pirdi to Bajaura watercourse), which involves more thrills due to strong rapids. Another enjoyable route is the Pirdi to Bhuntar course, which involves a smaller distance in comparison to the former.

Few days back I have read some of the Thrillophilia reviews and found it really good. 

So we contacted these guys and they offered me one of the best packages ever. We talked with the guys and they gave us a very decent package with all the adventure activities included. 

The booking process was hassle free. I really loved the way how this team has arranged everything so well including our food and activities. 

It was such a great adventure for all of us. We did some adventure activities like Jet Ski and the beach we were at was quite awesome.  

Most of the time, we spend on the beach and clicking pictures. Few of them went for some adventure activities like parasailing and also banana boat ride. 

We had quite an awesome time there; we also played some beach activities like beach volleyball and kabaddi. We had so much fun in the beach; some of them went for trekking in the nearby areas as well. 

As for the food we had some delicious meals during our whole trip. Our guide Ranjan helped us with everything possible. He used to keep up our spirits by sharing jokes and other trips he had done with other teams. 

We never had such fun filled team outing before this. Even we went beach hopping to few other beaches nearby. It was such a fun filled a refreshing day. 

I would really like to thanks Thrillophilia for making our Goa trip   memorable one. We hope to go out for some more fun filled trips with them. Hip Hip Hurray to this awesome team and organizers.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","296","0","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTt08f0c5ic"

But Thrillophilia did made a mark on our hearts by giving us the best Ladakh trip ever. We have gone through some Thrillophilia Ladakh reviews and really loved the way they had given such amazing experiences to people. 

I contacted with the team and they helped us through the booking process, it was hassle free. Right from the starting of our day from receiving us in the airport till the end of our trip, they have been very co operative. 

Our guide cum tour representative has been taking care of everything from our accommodation to our food. I really did love the way how he managed things for us as there have been lots of changes during the trip. 

It was awesome trip I would say and I am really glad that we came through thrillophilia. I have never seen anyone so patient and smart while dealing with the local operators. 

I have never seen my girl so happy before, it was the best trip for the both of us. The best of all for me was our trip to Nubra valley; it was the most memorable day of my life. 

Driving through the highest motorable road Khardungla was really awesome. We had to take sharp curves at few points and it was quite scary. 

But once we reached the stop we did spend some time exploring the beauty of the place. Another best part was the party which we did at Pangong Lake. 

I know, it seems a little crazy but we really did enjoy our night. It was not in our plan for camping at the Pangong Lake but Rohit our tour guide really helped us a lot in this. 

He arranged everything for us including the tents and the night party. It was a cold night but we set up a bonfire and gathered around together. 

We started sharing some old stories and also played antaksharee . It was such an awesome night for us, the stars glittering above us and the warm bonfire was the perfect time for all of us.

Also I would advise you guys to take some warm clothes with you if you are planning to camp at Pangong lake. 

We also went for double humped camel back ride at the cold desert which was another great experience for us. Food and accommodation was really great. 

I would definitely love to be back with Thrillophilia again and Meghalaya might be next on the list. My review will be definitely there in the Thrillophilia reviews for sure.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","323","0","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0HRoYk6GVA"

Undertake this unique trek on the frozen Zanskar river and get drawn to the surreal Himalayas draped with white snow, contrasting the piercing blue skies. 

During the peak winters, when this Ladakh frozen river trek is carried out, the temperature dips down to as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius, literally turning the river into a Chadar, a thick and solid sheet of ice and snow. Well, most parts of the river are frozen up to 6 feet of depth. As you walk on the frozen Zanskar river, you will notice that the ice is so clear that the colourful pebbles and stones on the riverbed are visible. 

Prepare Yourself for Chadar Trek 2020

Chadar trek is surely intense, and for that, you need to plan out your packing thoroughly. It is also crucial to have a moderate level of physical and mental fitness. Most importantly, you need to keep aside 3 days in Leh to first get acclimatized to the cold weather conditions. From the beginning, you will be trekking on the harsh terrain for 4-8 hours according to the weather conditions. 
As you get used to walking on the ice, every bend on the frozen river Chadar trek 2020 will offer another magnificent sight unfolding in front of you. At night while you huddle up near the warm bonfire with your group after a long day of walking, the inky sky gets filled with millions of twinkling stars. 

Chadar Trek Ladakh Weather & Temperature

The weather here changes quickly. At one point it can be very calm and on other times, there is a snowstorm blasting upon you and the Zanskar river gushing like a wild beast. Although one commendable thing is that the porters accompanying the frozen river trek Ladakh group brave this harsh weather, carry all the heavy luggage and help you along the trek, all with smiling faces.

With the stinging cold and adverse conditions at such high elevations, there will surely be highs and lows on your 9-day trek. As the finish line comes near, you will come across the frozen Nerak Waterfall, the most glorious view of your trek. With such serene vistas, you will surely enjoy living in the moment and be blissfully in a blank state of mind. 

So don’t wait up and start planning for your Chadar trek 2020 soon!

"114","pfUkJkgTs8Q","Thrillophilia Ladakh Reviews: Ladakh Sightseeing Trip Review","2017-09-07T13:11:26Z","I am not fond of scheduled tours or trips as I am a lazy traveler who plans short trips immediately and go for the nearby places. 

Hence when my friends booked Ladakh trip through Thrillophilia, I was very doubtful whether the trip was going to be entertaining or fun. 

In the initial days I was really lazy to get up early and pack everything for each day’s trek. 

But I should thank Thrillophilia for letting us mix with a superb group of friends from Delhi and the professionally qualified guide who was very energetic and supportive throughout the way. 

But I was really sad when we reached Rohtang Pass on our way to Leh from Manali. It was closed and I thought Oh God the trip was going to end and our holidays are screwed up. 

But immediately our guide came up with an alternate plan to continue riding toward Leh and you can reach Baralacha La by evening. 

Thus we went to Baralacha La Pass and we became so happy to reach there. All the places were amazing to see and too cold as well. 

But all the arrangements made by the guide and his team were appreciable. We were on time at all the places.

The co-ordination between the team was something surprised me well. I had so much fun while crossing Khardung La Pass and during the camp at Pangong Tso. Ladakh is such a beauty. 

I really wondered how it looks so beautiful every time. The only suggestion I had about the trip was the food could have been good. 

It was okay but one two days, they served Maggi alone. Anyway it was a grand holiday of 14 days for us with covering the favourite travel destinations in Leh and around with a nice team. 

We have done trekking at Pangong Tso, Tsokar, Nubra Valley and Manali. It was a brilliant experience for me as I was doing trekking and I had the best time with my besties over there. 

I have shared my happiness with Thrillophilia as well since they helped me book this package. I shared the feedback through Thrillophilia Ladakh review as well.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","230","0","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfUkJkgTs8Q"

"123","RZZB74Cf6fw","Thrillophilia Ladakh Jeep Safari Reviews","2017-09-07T13:12:52Z","I went on this first organized trip to Ladakh trip along with my friends. I was a little scared at first as most of time I prefer personal trips. 

But this time I connected with Thrillophilia and they have really organized an awesome trip for us. Anchit our guide has been a 
wonderful tour organizer. 

He has been with us from the starting of our trip. We have seen some Thrillophilia Ladakh Reviews and so we decided to go with them. 

We have been planning for a Ladakh trip for some long and Thrillophilia just made our dream come true. The best part of the whole trip was the road trip; this was one of my longest road trips. 

Our route was from Srinagar- Kargil- Leh and back. It was quite a thrilling ride. Passing through the highest motorable road Khardungla was another great experience for us. 

We also visited Nubra Valley and enjoyed the double humped camel ride. While at Nubra Valley we also visited the famous Dikshit Monastery, this monastery is the largest and oldest monastery and has a tall Buddha statue. 

There is just one suggestion which I would like to add from the whole trip. 

Please add better vehicles, other than that the trip was an awesome one. Our drive from Srinagar to Kargil in the Toyota Qualis was really comfortable. 

The travel from Leh to Nubra Valley was an awesome one; the hot spring was really nice. There are lots of good things but one good thing that I would like to remind it. 

It was a wonderful experience while we were camping near the Pangong Lake. I was stunned by the beauty of the lake; it keeps changing its colour from greenish to bluish hues. 

The tents provided to us were spacious and good. The flexibility that Thrillophilia gave and Anchit gave us was just perfect. Please so retain this flexibility for your future travelers as well. 

I hope this Thrillophilia Review Ladakh will be helpful for the adventure seekers.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","1208","1","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZZB74Cf6fw"

Leh was a dream location for me and I have been planning to visit this destination for a long time. 

It was then when I saw this particular event happening with Thrillophilia on facebook and I contacted the guy name Ranjith. He was very helpful and arranged everything for me. 

It was quite an awesome experience for me. Travelling through the narrow roads from Kargil with mountains as the backdrop was another best thing for me. 

After reaching Leh I along with few other group members who have joined us in Leh went to explore the Leh market. We continued our journey the next day and visited the Likir and Alchi monasteries.

The best part cam when we drove from Leh to Nubra valley.It was quite an awesome ride, driving through the highest motorable road was a great feeling. 

I was bit scared at the beginning as there were lot of sharp curves. Being a guy from Kerela, the mountains and the valley always attracted me. 

It was just the adventure I was looking for a long time. We also visited the Dikshit monastery and I was stunned by the statue of Buddha, it looked really beautiful. 

We could also see some monks chanting prayer; it was really a great feeling. The camping night near the Pangong Lake was also really fun. 

It was very cold at night so I would also advise to wear thermals inside your jacket while you are visiting Pangong Lake. We also visited the Thiksey monastery during the trip. 

Ladakh was awesome for me, I really loved it. I would love to have few more expeditions with Thrillophilia.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","101","0","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAkozKxBkkA"

It was quite a great package and we did have lot of fun together.  We have read the Thrillophilia reviews earlier and heard about the best team outing provided by the team. 

It was such a great day for all of us. We started at around 7:30 AM in the morning and reached our tour representative was counting heads as we headed to our vehicles. 

It was quite fun seeing such an enthusiastic guy.  All the activities and the places were chose by Thrillophilia. I would not stop praising these guys as they have made our team outing such a memorable one. 

Each of the activities and the places were really amazing. We were 35 people in our group and all of them were paid equal attention throughout the day. Some of us went for kayaking and rappelling. 

It was such a great adventure for us. For me rappelling was the best, I was a bit scared at the beginning when I had to climb up but it was all made easy by Mohan our guide. 

We also had fun when we went kayaking, the views of the whole surrounding was something which I will never forget. When we came back we were very tired and hungry. 

Oh what an awesome lunch we had, we were told that we will have veg meals but to our surprise they have also arranged non veg meals for us. 

I loved the team for giving us this surprise as most of us likes to eat non veg. We saw some of our friends trying archery and zip lining as well. 

Then we were asked to get ready for our team building activities which were another best part of our team outing.  We played many team activities like Jungle survival, raft building and jumbo cricket. 

We had the most amazing time of this time on this team outing activity. I would like to mention this in my Thrillophilia review team outing that we really did have the best time of our life. 

Keep arranging such good outing and the selection of the location were perfect for us. Cheers to such an awesome team and yes many more team outing with them.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","214","0","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlXU2QUZ3JA"

When we checked it, we found the package so attractive and we wanted something special for our kids as well. 

I am happy to give hundred points for Thrillophilia and this is my honest Thrillophilia review. I would recommend this package for all my friends and colleagues as well. 

The Adventure Camping and Activity near Kanakpura was an awesome camping space. We have gone there as a group of two families with around 10 people. 

The organizers were there to welcome us after we reached there and their behavior was commendable. It is a nice place to have fun with your family and for a great outing. Our kids were so happy to be amidst the greenery. 

The camping arranged was also proper and neat. I am so content with the timely arrangement of everything and my wife also liked
the neatness we could find in the environment. 

There was a lot of space for kids to play and have fun. There were several activities including trekking, ziplining, rappelling, archery, tennis, other rope activities, campfire and barbecue. 

It was a great package at very reasonable rate and families can spend ample time together away from the problems in office and tensions at home. It is the best place for relaxation. 

The food was really tasty though it was pure vegetarian food. Nicely cooked delicious homemade food. The barbecue was also delicious and it was the first time we ourselves tried something like that. So interesting. 

The staff was very friendly and understanding and we could approach them anytime. We are quite happy with Thrillophilia and its team who came here with us. We are so happy to share our experience with you and I would book more packages with you guys.

We had lots of fun and thrill throughout the whole day. It was such a fun filled day for all of us. The team has organized everything so well, right from the starting of our day till the end. 

We never had so much fun in team outing. We also had so many activities for the day. Rohit our guide not only helped us with the team building activities but also told us about the awesome trekking place nearby. 

Some of us went to explore the nearby trekking routes; it was such a great experience for all of us. The whole region is blessed with natural beauty and the surrounding was something which really did refresh us.  

After some crucial days at work we were looking for something peaceful and exciting, and this happens to be the best place for us. Some of my collegues went for rappelling and kayaking which was equally fun. 

After trekking I decided to do some rock climbing which was totally new for me. But it was really great when I did rock climbing, my friends were encouraging me all the time and it was really fun.

Some of my friends went for zip ling and kayaking in the nearby river. It had never had so much fun before. 

The best part came when we did our team building activities, we were a total of 40 members in our team and each of us had some important role to play throughout the activity. 

I am really happy with the arrangement of food as well, we enjoyed some delicious food. Although, it was a bit challenging at first but then it was really fun.

The best travel movies, as you will find out, have drawn inspiration from both the real life, and from most our dreams. Giving words to the feeling of wanderlust and providing an imagery of the physical form, these movies from all around the world give a tangible meaning to the intangible feeling of just fleeing our daily lives and go in search for peace.

The best travel movies are not the ones that showcase the story of a person who travelled like no one else did. Rather the best ones are those that provide the audience with the insight of why someone went to the distances they did. And the straight answer for that is “We travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us”. And a movie that evoke that feeling in you has done the best job that it could.

These top travel movies include many notable names like Queen, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and Tracks, and features many known actors like Kangana Ranaut, Ben Stiller, Hrithik Roshan, and Mia Wasikowska. And while most of these you may have already seen, there are so many noteworthy names in the list of the best travel movies that will equally affect the level of wanderlust that you carry around. 

And so, these names also find their way into the list of top travel movies that everyone must watch at least once in their life, and who knows, maybe seeing a documentary like “Somewhere Else Tomorrow” will probably make you want to be in a different place. 

Find inspiration to travel? Make these top travel movies into a list and start binging. For more travel related videos, stay tuned to our channel.

It was a package with adventure activities including a trekking. We had a lot of team building activities as well. A great pleasant outing with tented accommodation and a nice team. 

I take this opportunity to give Thrillophilia review team outing section. Guys, it was splendid since I have not seen many guys coming and participating in games in the office also. None of them was shy or reluctant to play games like ice breaking games, small fun games etc. 

They were all ready to do all the activities available there. I felt the trekking could have more challenging and nice. I am really fond of trekking. 

This was okay and my friends liked it very much. But personally, I think it could have been more exciting. The parallel walk was also not upto the level of my expectation. The place where it was conducted was not suitable. 

They could have made it to some other location. But I liked every other activity, campfire, music night and story telling session. 

I felt the first day was more vibrant and excellent than the second day. On the second day we were doing some games like badminton, carom and something similar. 

Then, we had a farewell section where almost all the people shared their experience at the campsite. 

I was quite happy with the arrangement especially, each activity was done on time without any delay so we could also come back to our places on the right time.

Everything was nicely arranged and organized by the organizers. The supporting staff was a wonderful team to be with. They were really helpful throughout the trip. 

They have taken care of us in a proper way without making any disturbance to anyone. 

Food was good and tasty and the tents were spacious and properly managed. Everything regarding the team outing was nice. 

I don’t think anyone else in my team will have something to tell opposite to what I shared. Thank you guys for giving us this package.","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","218","0","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziZMx0iX2kI"

"178","ZQiRj61HOpw","Thrillophilia Bangalore Reviews: Adventure Outing near Bangalore","2017-09-07T13:17:10Z","We were looking for some team outing and going through some Thrillophilia reviews regarding team outings. We really loved the way how they organized team outing and so booked a package for team outing for our GE team. 

It was quite a fun filled day for us. We met our colleagues and left Bangalore at around 8:00 AM in the morning. It was quite an awesome experience for all of us. 

The food provided during the day was really good. We also enjoyed a lot of activities like trekking, river rafting and rock climbing. It was quite a great adventure for us all of us. 

We were a total of 30 people in this team outing and they have very professionally organized everything. All the team of Thrillophilia was very helpful and connected to us regarding our simplest doubts. 

They have not only taken care of our food but also our security while we were doing some adventure activities. Our guide cum our tour representative was really helpful when we went for rock climbing. 

All our safety gears and ropes were tied to our body while we did this activity. We also did river rafting which was another hell of an adventure. 

Rowing through the waters with currents was quite a challenge for us but we managed it very well. Once done with our rafting adventure we went out for some trekking. 

This was the best part for me, the location was perfect and the views were something which I will remember forever. I never had so much fun in team outing before. 

We had some great time with our team as well, we also did some team building activity which were quite fun and thrilling. We have shared our feedback through Thrillophilia review Bangalore after this wonderful team outing. 

They have a wonderful team there who handles everything from your food to the best package of adventures. I think out of Thrillophilia team outing packages this is one of the best adventure packages. 

Hope we get to do some more outing with them. Cheers to some more adventures with them .","UC8MbRQQdYhNwOFeXmpK5UBw","Thrillophilia","35","0","0","0","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQiRj61HOpw"
