"245","This is to let you know about Financial Fraud and Misrepresentation drive carried out by Thrillophilia

Today I booked a package with Thrillophilia 
December 26, 2019; Time : 13:11Hrs 
Amount Paid : INR 59,573.00
Immediatly after booking I received a call from  customer care number 08094252221 at 13.49Hrs. The Customer care representative informed me that the destination I have booked is not available. He told me a 10times beter destination is available and if I would like to switch.

After I checked the alternate provided I realised that the alternate was not worth and I requested to refund my money.

This is where true marketing strategy of the company revealed. They told me that they will not refund my money and the only option i have is to forcibly select different destination which has far less facilities and is extremely crowded location. They Lure you with a Lowest Price Guarantee and then threaten to forfeit your money if you dont change your destination. 

I got fedup and booked my travel package with other vendor. 
Post that I got in touch couple of friends who shared that they to had bad experiences due to this misrepresentation and coercion method of Thrillophilia.


They trap you and force you to go to destination of their choice so that they can earn their 20% commission from vendors. 

One more FACT cam to light: there is no option for consumers to post their feedback or Honest REVIEWS. For example FB reviews cannot be manipulated or Deleted , so they have disabled FB Reviews so that people dont come to know about the fraudulent practices  Thrillophilia"

"270","If the Hr team at thrillophillia , really would have been concerned about their employees. Then they should atleast listen to vendors who add value to the overall experience of an employees journey in the organisation in a 360°approach.

I recommend not to ever book any tour packages from these people. Misleading website and no proper customer support.  Booked sikkim tour package with them and it was the most regretting decision ever made. There was no tour guide, the whole travel responsibility was given to some local drivers and everytime we had to call to thriollophia team to know about Hotel details. Most of our time was spent fixing their problems, as all the places mentioned in the iternary were either closed or permit was not given and they were not ready to include any alternative place as well. So as per their plan, we just have be in the hotel all the time and waste our money. All this time the team was silent and when we raised our concern, they are trying to prove us wrong. The expirence was really pathetic and never recommend thrillophilia."
